Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. The data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants was recorded as they were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

The main goal of the project is to predict the manner in which 6 participants performed these exercise as described below. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. The machine learning algorithm described here is applied to the 20 test cases available in the test data.
